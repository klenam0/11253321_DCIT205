# How To Clone And Set Up The Project

- In Visual Studio Code, open your open your bash terminal

- While Vs code is open, open github repo to fork from in your browser, using this link "https://github.com/Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA"

- In the DCIT_205_IA bar, find the fork button and click on it.

- Using this name convention “STUDENT ID_DCIT205” set a name for your repo

- From the code button drop-down list, copy the https link under the local clone section.

- Back in your git bash terminal opened in vs code, paste the link after the code :
  ~git clone
- For example:
  ~ git clone https://github.com/Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA.git

- Notice a README.md file appears in your current folder directory.

- If your additional code files are in a different directory, cut or copy all those files and paste it in the folder where your README.md file is. This folder will have the name you used when forking Danquiver1's repo for the IA. Example as the naming convention is “STUDENT ID_DCIT205”

- To activate your folder directory, use the command:
  ~cd "while pasting your local folder path"

  ~cd STUDENT ID_DCIT205
  This folder will be set as your main branch

- Add files to be tracked by using cmd:
  ~git add .

- To commit files, use cmd:
  ~git commit -m "enter any commit message"
